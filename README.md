# CSR-Racing-2
Project feedback, bug reports and comments are welcomed over at our discord server: https://discord.gg/XVZbNan <br>

**Notes:**<br>
In order to make it easier for players to find cars, and the original catalog was bloated, I took the time to optimize the catalog. The cars in the cars folder were changed from the activity classification to the brand classification, so that the classification is clearer in structure.

Finishing date: April 6, 2021

① Recently, we found that many users on Facebook use our photos. We welcome them to use them. However, some thieves even erase the author's information. It's very annoying that they don't respect our work achievements. Please give the author the most basic respect. Please keep the original author's information if you reprint and use them;<br>

② Donations are welcome!<br>
Keeping a project this big running smoothly really need lots of effort and we put lots of our free times into it.<br>
We will keep on releasing new cars as soon as the game update is rolled out and keep them nice and clean directly extract from the game codes **for free**.<br>
But we could need your help! Donate to this project and help us! Buy us a cup of coffee or a muffin will make our days!<br>
This is 100% optional and you can still use our project for free as usual. <br>
Join our discord channel and ask all about it in the project chatting room!<br>
Thanks for your support and happy racing!<br>
